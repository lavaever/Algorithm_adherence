         <h4>The Tasks</h4>
    <p>
        You just started as a demand planner at a semiconductor manufacturer.
        You are given three tasks: to forecast the sales of three different chipsets.
        Since your forecast will be used for further supply chain planning,
        your goal is to generate an unbiased forecast with as little error as possible
        so your colleagues have a good basis for planning.
    </p>
    <h4>Task Process</h4>
    <p>
        In each round of every task,
        you first make an initial forecast based on historical sales data.
        Next, you receive a model forecast.
        Then you give your final forecast for the round.
        In the end, you will see how you and the model have performed.
        Questionnaires will follow each task and after all three tasks have been completed.
    </p>
    <h4>The Model Forecast</h4>
    <p>
        Your boss told you that the model forecast is generated by a statistical forecasting software
        the company purchased.
        All information he has about this software is that it takes into the same historical sales data
        as you receive.
    </p>
    <h4>Measurement of Forecast Accuracy</h4>
    <p>
        Both the performance of your initial forecast and your final forecast
        will be measured by Mean Absolute Error(MAE).
        The lower the MAE,
        the higher your forecast accuracy is.
    </p>

    <h4>Performance Measurement</h4>
    <p>
        Your performance will be measured by the Mean Absolute Error(MAE).
        The lower the MAE, the higher your forecast accuracy and the better your performance.

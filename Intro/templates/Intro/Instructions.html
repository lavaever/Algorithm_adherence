     <h4>Welcome</h4>
     <p>
        Thank you for participating in the game.
     </p>
     <p>
        Please read the instructions below carefully to make sure you understand the instructions.
        If you have any question, please notify the operator.
     </p>
     <p>
         Please <strong>do not</strong> communicate with other participants during the entire game.
     </p>
     <p>
        The game will begin with a few questions to check your understanding of the instructions.
        You will be able to continue after you have answered the questions correctly.
     </p>
    <h4>Background Information</h4>
    <p>
        You just started as a demand planner at a semiconductor manufacturer.
        Your task is to forecast the sales of three different chipsets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since your forecast will be used for further production and capacity planning,
        your goal is to generate a forecast with as little error as possible
        so others have a good basis for planning.
    </p>
    <h4>The process</h4>
    <p>
        To forecast the sales of a chipset for the period you are in,
        you will first be provided with past sales data shown in a chart.
        You will then be asked to enter an initial forecast based on this data.
    </p>
    <p>
        After clicking on “next”,
        you will be supplied with a sales forecast generated by a statistical model.
        You will also see a chart with past sales data, historical model forecast and your past forecast if available.
        Please note that the statistical model only has as many data inputs as you do in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you will be asked to enter a final forecast for the period.
        Only the value you enter as the final forecast will be taken to measure your overall forecast accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you will see a summary table of the period and you continue to the next period.
        {% if player.role == 'treatment' %} For some periods, more information might follow the summary page. {% endif %}
    </p>

    <h4>Performance Measurement</h4>
    <p>
        Your performance will be measured by the Mean Absolute Error(MAE).
        The lower the MAE, the higher your forecast accuracy and the better your performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        MAE = 1/n * SUM(Your Final Forecast – Actual Sales)
    </p>
